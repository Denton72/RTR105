3.3 Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
Score Grade
>= 0.9 A
>= 0.8 B
>= 0.7 C
>= 0.6 D
< 0.6 F
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85. 


try:
 score = float(input("Enter Score between 0.0 and 1.0: "))
except:
    print("SORRY you entered some thing wrong")
if 0.0 <= score <= 1.0:
  if score >= 0.9:
    results="A"
  elif 0.9 >= score >= 0.8:
    results="B"
  elif 0.8 >= score >= 0.7:
    results="C"
  elif 0.7 >= score >= 0.6:
    results="D"  
  elif score < 0.6:
    results="F"  
    
  print (results)   
else:
 print("SORRY you entered some thing wrong")
